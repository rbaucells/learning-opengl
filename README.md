## Overview
- Game engine made from scratch in c++ with very little dependencies. Intended to
help me learn complicated things in game dev and game engine design

## Dependencies
- GLFW - For cross-platform window creation
- GLAD - For loading modern Opengl functions

## Goals
- Learn how to work with graphics programming
- Learn how to work with c++
- Learn interesting math used in game dev (Matrices, Vectors)
- Learn how game engines (like Unity, Unreal, Godot) work in the backend
- Make games how I want with no limitations (If that makes sense)
- ### Goals for Engine itself
  - Scene saving/loading system
  - Animation system
  - GUI for editing scenes
